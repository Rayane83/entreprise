The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the Portail Entreprise Flashback Fa application by building a substantial portion of the frontend using React, TailwindCSS, and shadcn/ui components. The initial phase focused on replicating the UI with mocked data, including complex forms and pages like Dotations, Blanchiment, and Superadmin. Debugging involved fixing module errors and simulating user authentication within  to make the UI appear functional.

The conversation then shifted towards backend integration, with the user explicitly requesting a Supabase-based backend. Challenges arose when the provided Excel files for export formats were corrupted, leading the AI to proceed with textual requirements for the  component's role restrictions and data paste functionality. The AI is currently in the process of setting up the Supabase client and related services, having already added necessary dependencies and created foundational files for Supabase integration.

The goal is to replicate Portail Entreprise Flashback Fa as a full-stack application. It features a React frontend, a FastAPI backend (initially provided, but shifted to Supabase), and MongoDB (initially provided, but shifting to Supabase as DB). Key pages include Dashboard, Dotations, Impôts, Factures/Diplômes, Blanchiment, Archives, Config, SuperStaff, and Patron Config. The application must adhere to a strict design system (HSL tokens, Tailwind, shadcn/ui), SEO, accessibility, and responsive design, with identical UX. Supabase integration is critical for authentication (Discord OAuth), database (specific SQL schema, RLS, triggers), and storage. Role-based access control (staff, patron, co-patron, dot, employe) dictates read/write permissions across features. Recent user requests include implementing Excel exports based on provided formats (for Impôts, Blanchiment, Archives), restricting Blanchiment activation/deactivation to staff only (patrons view-only), adding a copy-paste area for Blanchiment data, and a back button for configuration pages.

<code_architecture>
The application architecture comprises a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, although the focus is shifting to Supabase for backend services.



-   : Main React component, handles routing with . Modified to import  and initially included a  call to the FastAPI backend, which will be replaced by Supabase interactions.
-   : Entry point for React application, mounting the  component.
-   : Centralized file for storing all mocked data used by frontend components. This will eventually be replaced by actual data from Supabase.
-   : Represents the main application page, designed to host various features via tabs (Dashboard, Dotations, Impôts, etc.).
-   : Component for user authentication, specifically Discord OAuth via Supabase.
-   : Component responsible for controlling access to features based on user roles.
-   : Displays key statistics and summaries on the dashboard.
-   : Page displayed for routes that do not exist.
-   : Handles dotation calculations, employee input, and archiving, with role-based access restrictions.
-   : Component for tax-related forms and logic.
-   : Manages the upload of documents, likely to Supabase storage.
-   : Component for managing anti-money laundering settings. This file was recently modified to enforce staff-only activation/deactivation, patron view-only access, and to include a data paste area.
-   : Displays and manages archived data, with features for search, Excel export, and staff-only actions.
-   : Configuration options accessible by staff members.
-   : Central administration page for managing various application settings and data.
-   : Configuration page specific to company settings, accessible by patrons.
-   : Manages the global authentication state of the user. This file was modified to include a mocked logged-in user for initial frontend development.
-   : *New file* to configure and export the Supabase client instance, handling URL and publishable key.
-   : *New file* intended to encapsulate Supabase authentication logic, such as  and .
-   , , : CSS and Tailwind configuration files defining the application's design system, including HSL tokens.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete implementation of Excel export functionality for Impôts, Blanchiment, and Archives.
-   Fully integrate the copy-paste zone for data insertion within the Blanchiment section.
-   Implement the back button functionality in configuration pages.
-   Complete the full Supabase backend integration, including creating SQL tables, RLS policies, triggers, and configuring edge functions.

<current_work>
The application's frontend is largely structured and rendered, using mock data for most components, providing a visual representation of the final product. A key development was the modification of  to automatically simulate a logged-in test user, allowing the UI to render beyond a login screen. This enabled further frontend development and screenshot verification, confirming the main dashboard's functionality.

The AI engineer has recently shifted focus to backend integration with Supabase, as requested by the user. Initial steps involved installing the  library. Following this, two new files have been created:  to configure the Supabase client with the provided URL and key, and  to centralize authentication-related functions. The user has explicitly asked for verification of this Supabase setup, indicating that the current state is mid-configuration, with environment variables for Supabase still needing to be addressed.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to correctly configure the environment variables required for Supabase integration.
