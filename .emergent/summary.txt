The trajectory details the development of the Portail Entreprise Flashback Fa application, transitioning from a React frontend with mocked data to a full-stack application integrated with Supabase. The initial phase involved implementing UI components and mock data for features like Excel exports and a copy-paste area. The bulk of the work then shifted to Supabase integration, covering client setup, database schema, RLS, and Discord OAuth. A significant portion of the conversation revolved around extensive deployment troubleshooting on a VPS, tackling Nginx configuration, SSL issues, persistent old frontend builds, and refining the Discord authentication flow to ensure a production-ready, non-mocked experience. The process was highly iterative, with the AI engineer creating numerous shell scripts for the user to execute on their VPS to fix various environmental and application-level bugs. The trajectory concludes with the user reporting issues with button functionality and requesting new features for enterprise and role management.

The objective is to build a full-stack Portail Entreprise Flashback Fa application with a React frontend and Supabase backend (migrating from FastAPI/MongoDB). It requires a comprehensive set of pages: Dashboard, Dotations, Impôts, Factures/Diplômes, Blanchiment, Archives, Config, SuperStaff, and Patron Config. The UI must be highly consistent, using HSL tokens, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components, adhering to SEO, accessibility, and responsiveness. Supabase is critical for Discord OAuth authentication, database (specific SQL schema, RLS, triggers), and storage. Role-based access control (staff, patron, co-patron, dot, employe) is a core requirement. Explicit feature requests include Excel exports for Impôts, Blanchiment, and Archives, staff-only activation for Blanchiment with a data paste area, and a back button for configuration pages. Recent user demands focused on achieving a 100% functional production site with real Discord authentication, removing Made with Emergent branding, resolving instant session logout, and implementing automatic redirection for a specific Discord ID to the  page. The latest requests are to ensure all existing buttons function correctly, add new enterprise creation (Discord Guild ID, Name, Main Guild Role ID), configure staff/patron/co-patron/dot role IDs from a specific Dot guild, and include a main page button.

<code_architecture>
The application architecture is a React frontend coupled with a Supabase backend, evolving from an initial FastAPI/MongoDB setup.



-   : Stores environment variables, critically updated with new Supabase URL and key.
-   : Main router, modified for strict Discord authentication and  implementation.
-   : Component for Discord OAuth login, heavily refactored to remove mock logic and implement real Supabase-based authentication.
-   : Manages global auth state, modified to use real Supabase sessions and Discord role resolution, removing all mock user data.
-   : Configures and exports the Supabase client instance.
-   : Encapsulates Supabase authentication logic, updated for Discord roles and error handling.
-   : A new file to centralize Supabase database interactions.
-   : Enhanced with a copy-paste area and Excel export functionality, enforcing role-based access.
-    & : Updated to include correct  for back buttons.
-    & : Modified to add Excel export functionality.
-   : New utility for Excel data exports.
-   , , , : New UI components/utilities created to resolve dependencies and support features.
-   , , : Files defining Supabase database schema, row-level security policies, and Edge Functions for role management.
-   Various  scripts (, , , etc.): Numerous scripts were created for VPS deployment, Nginx/SSL configuration, PM2 management, cache clearing, and general bug fixing in the production environment.

<pending_tasks>
-   Ensure all existing buttons within the application are fully functional.
-   Implement the functionality to add a new enterprise, including input fields for Discord Guild ID, Enterprise Name, and the Role ID from the main guild.
-   Add configuration for Staff, Patron, Co-Patron, and Dot role IDs, which should be sourced from a Dot guild.
-   Create a dedicated button for navigating to the main page of the application.

<current_work>
The application has largely transitioned from a mocked frontend to a Supabase-integrated backend. Significant effort has been expended on deploying the application to a VPS, addressing numerous Nginx configuration and SSL certificate issues, and ensuring the correct production build is served. Most recently, the focus was on stabilizing the Discord OAuth authentication flow. The AI engineer implemented a fix for the instant logout problem after a user connects via Discord and also introduced a specific redirection rule for the Discord ID  to automatically navigate to the  page. This was achieved by providing the  script to the user. The AI's last assessment, prior to the final user message, was that Discord authentication was working and the admin redirection was successfully implemented. However, the user's subsequent feedback indicates that while the core login might be progressing, other UI elements, specifically the buttons, are still non-functional, and new feature requests for enterprise and role configuration have been introduced.
